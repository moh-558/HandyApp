<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Handy App

This project aims to connect the tradespeople to the people that need their services and skills. 
In the app, sellers that are selling their services and skills signup and upload information about their services, images, and any other relevant information.

When a buyer or someone wants services, they sign up and browse the categories and once they click on a specific category, they will see all the sellers in that category. 
Buyers can choose the people they want to hire based on their price and reviews about the services they offer.

Once they choose a seller, they can contact them by private message and arrange when or where to meet.
At the end of the transaction, the buyer will pay the seller through the app and can leave a review and a 5-stare-based rating on how they did.
